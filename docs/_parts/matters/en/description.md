Matters are an idea or a periodic activity of an institution. Matters can be
related to goals, i.e. by solving a matter we can see it as a progress towards
a goal.

This matter has an abstractly defined consideration time. The set of matters can 
be equated to an institution, e.g.: an annual work schedule.

When a meeting is organized, from these matters (topics) it is possible to create
agenda items, which are related to the respective meeting, created from the
institution object.
