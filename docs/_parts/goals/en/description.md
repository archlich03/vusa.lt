Goal is an idea that, when implemented, creates a desired and, usually
good, positive and significant impact on the group of people implementing
the goal.

Goal is **not**:
- An activity. E.g.: "organize an event for 100 people for some occasion" is NOT a goal.
- A group of goals (on this platform). E.g.: "implementation of 60 credits
at Vilnius University", when it is discussed in departments, will be a
group of goals. The goal will be: implementation of 60 credits in VU
FPhys study programmes.
